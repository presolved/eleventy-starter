# Angular Signals Quickstart

Welcome to the Angular Signals Quickstart workshop! 

We are thrilled you are here and we hope this workshop is a fun and painless way to learn about Angular Signals. We put a lot of effort into trying to find the balance between "approachable" and "interesting." Our goal is that you would be able to work through the examples and challenges in less than an hour and have fun doing it.
