We are going to be updating a Wordle-style application to use Angular Signals. 

We are not going to be digging into every detail of the application but instead, focus on just the parts that are relevant to Angular Signals. 

Disclaimer! This project is in no way shape or form a production-ready application and so any criticism of the code will be probably met with a "I could not agree more!" 

With that said, if you have any suggestions on a novel implementation or critical concept we missed, we would love to hear about it. 

## The Code
This workshop is done entirely in Stackblitz because it is just so easy to get started!

Click on the starter link and you will be taken to the project. We have gone ahead and created some of the basic files for you so you can get started right away.

Use this starter project and then fork it so it will be saved to your Stackblitz account.
